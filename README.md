## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

### Backend
-   **Framework**: Laravel 12
-   **PHP Version**: 8.2
-   **Authentication**: Laravel Sanctum
-   **Admin Panel**: Filament 3
-   **Database**: PostgreSQL

### Frontend
-   **Framework**: Flutter 3
-   **State Management**: Provider
-   **Networking**: Dio
-   **Local Storage**: Shared Preferences

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Backend Architecture
The backend is a monolithic application built with the Laravel framework. It follows the standard MVC pattern and provides a RESTful API for the frontend application. It uses Laravel Sanctum for API token-based authentication. The Filament admin panel is integrated for easy administration of the application's data.

### Frontend Architecture
The frontend is a Flutter application that follows the principles of Clean Architecture. The code is structured into three main layers:
-   **Domain**: Contains the core business logic, models (entities), and repository interfaces.
-   **Data**: Implements the repositories defined in the domain layer and is responsible for fetching data from the API.
-   **Presentation**: Contains the UI (Widgets/Screens) and the state management logic (Providers) that connects the UI to the business logic.

2.  Copy the environment file: `cp .env.example .env`
3.  Install PHP dependencies: `composer install`
4.  Install NPM dependencies: `npm install`
5.  Generate an application key: `php artisan key:generate`
6.  Configure your database credentials in the `.env` file.
7.  Run database migrations: `php artisan migrate`
8.  (Optional) Seed the database: `php artisan db:seed`
9.  Start the development server: `php artisan serve` or use the configured `dev` script: `composer run dev`

### Frontend Setup
1.  Navigate to the `frontend` directory: `cd frontend`
2.  Install Flutter dependencies: `flutter pub get`
3.  Make sure the backend server is running and the API endpoint is correctly configured in `frontend/lib/core/config/api_config.dart`.
4.  Run the app: `flutter run`

## üë®‚Äçüíª Admin Panel
The application includes a comprehensive admin panel built with Filament. To access it:
1.  Ensure the backend server is running.
2.  Create an admin user. You can do this via a seeder or by creating a user and setting their `role` to `admin` in the database.
3.  Navigate to `/admin` in your browser.
